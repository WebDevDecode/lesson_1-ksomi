<h1>About me</h1>
<h4>My name is Kamilla, I was born in Semey city.
    In 2020 I graduated from Ablai Khan University with a Bachelor's degree in English linguistics.
    At the moment I work as an Expert in the Scientific Library of Suleyman Demirel University.
    My interests include films, fiction books and politics. 
    Before choosing this course, I started to explore Java programming language and quite enjoyed it.
    My goal is to challenge myself in a new field and possibly open new opportunities. 
    That is all, thank you!
